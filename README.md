# busy-mango

An Obsidian plugin for task planning.

The spiritual successor to [busy-lemon](https://github.com/AskePit/busy-lemon).

**DISCLAIMER:**  
This plugin is **experimental**, **unstable**, and **not** production-ready. It's rough around the edges and requires manual tweaks to function properly. It also **doesn't fully comply** with Obsidian’s official plugin guidelines. I use it for personal purposes — use it at your own risk.

## How It Works

The plugin is designed to work primarily with the [Kanban plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban), but it can also be used with plain Markdown to-do lists.

It scans kanban boards and other Markdown files with a to-do structure from a specified folder. Based on your task and project history, along with priority rules, it can suggest what to work on next.

> **Note:** Even if the Kanban plugin is disabled, _busy-mango_ will still work, since it reads raw Markdown files. Kanban boards are, at their core, just Markdown to-do lists.

## Setting Up Projects and Tasks

Create a separate folder for your project kanban boards — one board per project. Use columns like `In Work`, `TODO`, and `Repetitive`, and feel free to add additional columns for backlog or other purposes. The plugin only considers tasks from specific columns (see below), and ignores others.

The plugin prioritizes tasks in the `In Work` and `Repetitive` columns. If `In Work` is empty, it will also look in the `TODO` column. All other columns are ignored when suggesting tasks.

> **NOTE:** On startup, the plugin modifies your project Markdown files to insert metadata:
> 
> - Invisible HTML comment markers with IDs like `<!-- id: 15 -->`
>     
> - YAML frontmatter fields
>     

**Do not edit or delete these markers manually. Doing so will break the plugin and may cause unpredictable behavior.**

### Frontmatter Fields Per Project

Each project file will include autogenerated fields like:
- `id`: An auto-incremented internal identifier (do not change this)
- `urgency`: Project urgency — `none`, `low`, `normal`, `high`, `urgent` (default: `normal`)
- `strategy`: Strategic importance — same values as above (default: `normal`)
- `interest`: Personal interest in the project — same values as above (default: `normal`)

For accurate suggestions, **manually adjust** the `urgency`, `strategy`, and `interest` fields for each project.

Tasks inherit their priority from their project. However, you can override urgency by adding an exclamation mark `!` at the beginning of a task description, like `! Wash the cat`

This marks the task as **urgent**, regardless of the project’s default.

## Using the Plugin

1. Click the **Busy Mango** button in the left sidebar.
2. A plugin panel will open in the main area.
3. If a task was already assigned, you’ll be asked whether you completed or dropped it. Your answer will affect the plugin’s memory.
4. Use the filter buttons to narrow down which tasks the plugin considers. If unsure, click **Any** to scan all tasks in the working folder.
5. The plugin will suggest a task based on these priorities (from most to least important):
    - Projects you haven’t worked on in a while get higher priority
    - More urgent tasks are prioritized
    - More strategic tasks are prioritized
    - More interesting tasks are prioritized
    - Randomness is applied as a tiebreaker
6. If you reject the suggested task, the plugin will propose another suitable one.
7. If there are no suitable tasks left, the plugin will notify you.
